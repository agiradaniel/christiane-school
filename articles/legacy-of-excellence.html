        <h2>The Beginning (2004)</h2>
        <p>Back in 2004, Kitengela had very few private schools. Mr. Jeremiah Agira, a retired Mechanical Engineering Lecturer, and Mrs. Margaret Agira, a retired Business Lecturer, struggled to find a good school for their young child who was just about to start school.</p>
        
        <p>Seeing an opportunity to provide quality education for their child and other children in the area, they decided to establish Christiane School. With their extensive knowledge and passion for education, the foundation of the school was set.</p>

        <h2>The Name "Christiane"</h2>
        <p>The school is named in honor of Christiane, a German lady who was instrumental in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Agira during their time in Germany in the late 1990s. The name serves as a tribute to her kindness and generosity.</p>

        <h2>The First Steps</h2>
        <p>Construction of the school began in early 2004 with a single modest classroom. Though simple, it was enough to start. The very first student was none other than the Agiras' son—symbolizing their trust in the vision and quality of Christiane School.</p>
        
        <p>He excelled in his education and is now a software engineer working with major insurance companies across Africa. His story is one among many that reflect the school's dedication to academic excellence.</p>

        <h2>Alumni Success</h2>
        <p>Over the years, Christiane School has nurtured a strong network of alumni excelling in diverse fields including:</p>
        <ul class="alumni-list">
          <li>Software Engineering</li>
          <li>Medicine</li>
          <li>Engineering</li>
          <li>Medical Research</li>
          <li>Business and other industries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This broad impact is a testament to the school's holistic and quality education system.</p>

        <h2>Embracing Technology Early</h2>
        <p>As early as 2006, Christiane School was already integrating computer classes into its curriculum. Students began learning with the old bulky computers running on Windows XP, which gradually evolved into a state-of-the-art computer lab with modern machines.</p>
        
        <p>This early embrace of technology has produced many software engineers and professionals proficient in industry tools such as AutoCAD for engineering and specialized software for medical research.</p>

        <h2>Holistic Student Development</h2>
        <p>Christiane School is not only about academics—it ensures every child has a chance to thrive in their areas of interest. Students who need extra support are nurtured individually so no one is left behind.</p>
        
        <p>The school also emphasizes extracurricular activities including:</p>
        <ul class="activities-list">
          <li>Sports and swimming</li>
          <li>Fun days and drama</li>
          <li>Talent development programs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These activities help children discover their strengths early, shaping their future success.</p>

        <h2>Dedicated Teachers</h2>
        <p>With the guidance of the directors, the school carefully selects top-notch teachers who embody compassion, diligence, and patience. The staff understands that children learn differently and require patience, making Christiane a supportive learning environment.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
        <p>Christiane School also enriches students' perspectives through:</p>
        <ul class="enrichment-list">
          <li>Educational shows</li>
          <li>Adventure trips</li>
          <li>Visits to national parks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These experiences broaden their minds and connect learning with real-life encounters.</p>

        <h2>The Mission Continues</h2>
        <p>From a humble beginning to a thriving institution, Christiane School continues to grow while producing sharp, well-rounded minds for different industries. The founding vision of equal opportunity, holistic growth, and academic excellence remains at the core of everything the school does.</p>
